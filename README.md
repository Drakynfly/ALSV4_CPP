## About
- This fork is my (Guy Lundvall, aka Drakynfly) customized version of ALSV4_Community by dyanikoglu that adds features that I need for my project. Since I've gotten so much out of this plugin I'm leaving this repo public for anyone else who can find use in it.

## Features
- All the features of the original. I generally keep this up-to-date with the latest release.
- Flight support. This is the main point of this fork, and hence the name for it: Faerie ALS.
- Swimming support planned. (Currently the framework is added but no animations)
- Mounting added as a third stance. Disables character movement and redirects input to external actors.
- Integration with other gameplay systems; e.g system to allow movement speed to be modified by external systems, such as an inventory, or world weather.
- Extra mantling features: Auto-mantling over short obstacles.
- Some features are being reimplemented differantly, according to the design of Project Faerie.

## Known Issues
- No animations for flying and swimming right now, just the framework.
- See [Issues](https://github.com/dyanikoglu/ALSV4_CPP/issues) section
